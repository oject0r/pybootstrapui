# PyBootstrapUI v1.1.1 Changelog  

## Major Changes  

### **Dependency Count Reduced to 2 (from 9)**  
To make PyBootstrapUI more lightweight and efficient, several dependencies have been removed, and only one has been added:  
- **Removed Dependencies**:
  - `rjsmin`  
  - `httpx`  
  - `pygments`  
  - `pyinstaller`  
  - `fastapi`  
  - `uvicorn`  
  - `markdown`  
  - `typing_extensions`  

- **Added Dependency**:  
  - `aiohttp`  
    The server now runs on **aiohttp.web** instead of **FastAPI**, significantly reducing the framework's footprint while maintaining performance.  

### **Introducing Modifiers**  
Modifiers provide a flexible way to apply styles and layouts to components. Here's an example of how to use them:  

```python
from pybootstrapui import Page
from pybootstrapui.desktop.built import NWJSPath
from pybootstrapui.modifiers import *
from pybootstrapui.components import *

page = Page()
button = Button(label="Submit", modifier=ButtonModifier() \
  .color(ButtonStyle.SUCCESS_OUTLINE))

CENTER_MODIFIER = Modifier() \
  .display(DisplayValues.FLEX) \
  .justify_content(JustifyContent.CENTER)

container = Div(button)
CENTER_MODIFIER.apply(container)

page.add(button)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    page.run_in_desktop(NWJSPath)
```  

- The `Modifier` class, available in the `pybootstrapui.modifiers` module, allows you to create and apply custom styles and layouts.  
- The `enums` and `types` folders have been removed and replaced with the `modifiers` module for better organization and usability.  

### **Project Structure Updates**  
- The `enums` and `types` folders have been consolidated into the `modifiers` module.  
- This change simplifies the project structure and makes it easier to manage styles and layouts.

## Minor Changes  

- **Value Handling**:  
  - Every `HTMLElement` that has a value now inherits from `HasValue` instead of `HTMLElement`.  

- **Removed Modules**:  
  - The `charts.py` module has been removed.  

- **Line Breaks and Horizontal Lines**:  
  - `Br()` is no longer deprecated. You can add line breaks using either `LineBreak` or `Br()`.  
  - `Hr()` can be used as `HorizontalLine`.  

- **New Method**:  
  - Added `Page.get_by_id(ID)` to easily retrieve elements by their ID.  

- **Mirror Downloads**:  
  - Mirror downloads have been discontinued due to security concerns and budget constraints.  

- **Default Project Template**:  
  - The default project template has been updated to reflect the latest changes and improvements.  

- **Header Icons**:  
  - The `Header.bi` parameter has been removed. Icons should now be passed directly in the `*text` argument.  

- **Tests**:  
  - All tests have been updated to align with the new project structure and features.
